"We'll keep your tokens safe, even if you've lost your marbles."

I recently experienced a somewhat serious mental malfunction which I can only hope was precipitated by the medication I am currently taking. 

I am taking measures directly to avoid having a recurrance, but I am now seriously concerned with preventing the harm that results from actions of those who have the authority and power to act, but who have lost the the reasoning capacity required to have such authority or power. 

Whether incapacitation results from a medical condition or any other reason, real harm can result. Some examples include: being scammed, spending sprees, bad investments, physical damage to property, physical injury, and death.

In my case, it was the middle of the afternoon. I felt tired, stressed, and was in a hurry. I saw a video on YouTube indicating that the Ethereum foundation was doing an "air drop" wherein persons send them tokens gets double back. I doubted it at first, but the account had 250,000 subscribers so I believed it was legitimate and that somehow I had effectively just won a lottery. 

I can only say that I was in some sort of dream-like state. I am usually exceptionally skeptical. I think I know "how bad the world is" out there. Normally I have no such trust. 

I believed YouTube was more invincible to that kind of thing. Like a child I saw the possibility of a great, fantastically fortunate windfall coming our way, if only I acted quickly enough. And it seemed I couldn't. I seemed to have trouble finding the blanks on forms to enter the passcodes of my accounts.

But I persisted. And sent in 19 tokens (about $4,000, or more than I earn in two months). In a half-hour, it was clear what had happened. I was livid with myself then and I have no great appreciation for me now.

I was reluctant to obtain digital currency because I feared I would lose it through negligence or other error. Once I had made about twenty transactions, I began to feel more confident. Too confident, it turned out. 

Just enough over-confidence to discover a problem even more serious than negligence and about which I had not an inkling. Dementia. I currently can only hope that my dream-like experience is not actually the result of an early-onset dementium....

In the meantime, there is this notion of protecting our digital resources from the effects of such experiences irrespective of etiology.

Perhaps making this wallet will free me from self-loathing evoked in this incident.
