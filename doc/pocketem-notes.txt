Digital assets: necessary evil?


I don't like the word "own" but I do believe that there are "usage rights" which may be appropriately allowed and restricted.

Digital stuff is pretty darn tiny and hard to hold. Barely more than the weight of an idea.

But let's say you have some "stuff" that is for your use.

you want it to be there when you need it

    it is persistent and secured
    
    it is accessible
    
 it is recoverable
 
 it is transferrable
